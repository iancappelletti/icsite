The original text was "translated" into pseudo-swashbuckling pirate-speak. This is a silly exercise, but maybe someone with a penchant for Dread Pirate Roberts will enjoy it?</span><h2>Transcript</h2><p><span style="font-weight:400">Twas an ancient Mariner, with a beard long and gray, and an eye that glittered like a doubloon. He clutched one of three lads passin' by.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">"By yer long gray beard and glitterin' eye, tell me, why d'ye stop me, ye old sea dog?" cried the lad.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">"The Bridegroom's doors swing wide, and I be next of kin! The jolly guests are met, the feast is set, ye can hear the merry din!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The Mariner, with a bony hand, held him fast. "There was a ship," quoth he.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">"Avast there! Let go o' me, ye gray-beard loon!" But too late, the Mariner's grip was cast off.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Yet, he held him with his glittering eye, and the Wedding-Guest stood still as a statue, listenin' like a three-year-old babe. The Mariner had his way.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The Wedding-Guest, he plopped himself down on a stone, for he had no choice but to hear. And thus spake on that ancient man, the bright-eyed Mariner.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The ship was cheered, the harbor cleared, and merrily did we drop below the kirk, below the hill, below the light-house top.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The Sun himself came up from the left, risin' from the sea! And he shone bright, and on the right, he dipped back into the waves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Higher and higher every day, 'til over the mast at noon! The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast, for he heard the loud bassoon.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The bride, she paced into the hall, red as a rose, she be! Nodding their heads before her went the merry minstrelsy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The Wedding-Guest, he beat his breast once more, yet he couldn't but hear. And thus spake on that ancient man, the bright-eyed Mariner.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">And now the STORM-BLAST came, a tyrannical and mighty foe! He struck with his o'ertaking wings, and chased us south along.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">With masts a-slopin' and prow a-dippin', like one pursued with yell and blow, still treadin' the shadow of his foe, and forward bendin' his head. The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast, and southward aye we fled!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">And then came both mist and snow, and it grew wondrous cold! And ice, mast-high, came floatin' by, as green as a pirate's emerald!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">And through the drifts, the snowy clifts sent a dismal sheen. No shapes of men nor beasts could we ken&mdash;the ice was all between!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The ice was here, the ice was there, the ice was all around! It cracked and growled, and roared and howled, like noises in a swound!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">At last, an Albatross did cross our path! Through the fog it came, as if it had been a Christian soul. We hailed it in God's name!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">It ate the food it ne'er had eaten, and round and round it flew! The ice did split with a thunder-fit; the helmsman steered us through!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">And a good south wind sprung up behind; the Albatross did follow! And every day, for food or play, it came to the mariners' hollo!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud, it perched for vespers nine. While all the night, through fog-smoke white, glimmered the white Moon-shine.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">"God save ye, ancient Mariner! From the fiends that plague ye thus! Why look'st thou so?" With my cross-bow, I shot the ALBATROSS!</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The Sun, he now rose upon the right: out o' the sea he came, still hid in mist, and on the left, he dipped back into the sea.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">And the good south wind still blew behind, but no sweet bird did follow. Nor any day for food or play came to the mariners' hollo!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">And I, the scallywag, had done a hellish thing, and it would bring 'em woe! For all averred, I had killed the bird that made the breeze to blow. "Ah, ye wretch!" said they, "The bird to slay that made the breeze to blow!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Neither dim nor red, like God's own head, the glorious Sun uprist! Then all averred, I had killed the bird that brought the fog and mist. " 'Twas right," said they, "such birds to slay, that bring the fog and mist."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew, the furrow followed free. We were the first that ever burst into that silent sea!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Down dropped the breeze, the sails dropped down, 'twas sad as sad could be! And we did speak only to break the silence of the sea!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">All in a hot and copper sky, the bloody Sun, at noon, right up above the mast did stand, no bigger than the Moon!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Day after day, day after day, we stuck, neither breath nor motion! As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Water, water, every where, and all the boards did shrink! Water, water, every where, nor any drop to drink!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The very deep did rot: By the beard of Neptune! That ever this should be! Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs upon the slimy sea.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">About, about, in reel and rout, the death-fires danced at night! The water, like a witch's oils, burnt green, and blue, and white.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">And some in dreams were sure of the spirit that plagued us so: Nine fathom deep he had followed us from the land of mist and snow.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">And every tongue, through utter drought, was withered at the root. We could not speak, no more than if we had been choked with soot.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Ahoy! What evil looks had I from old and young! Instead of the cross, the Albatross about my neck was hung.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">There passed a weary time. Each throat was parched, and glazed each eye. A weary time! A weary time! How glazed each weary eye, when looking westward, I beheld a something in the sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">At first it seemed a little speck, and then it seemed a mist. It moved and moved, and took at last a certain shape, I wist.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist! And still it neared and neared! As if it dodged a water-sprite, it plunged and tacked and veered.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">With throats unslaked, with black lips baked, we could not laugh nor wail! Through utter drought all dumb we stood! I bit my arm, I sucked the blood, and cried, "A sail! A sail!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">With throats unslaked, with black lips baked, agape they heard me call: "Gramercy!" they for joy did grin, and all at once their breath drew in, as they were drinking all!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">"See! See!" (I cried) "She tacks no more! Hither to work us weal! Without a breeze, without a tide, she steadies with upright keel!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The western wave was all a-flame, the day was well nigh done! Almost upon the western wave rested the broad bright Sun; when that strange shape drove suddenly betwixt us and the Sun.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">And straight the Sun was flecked with bars, (Heaven's Mother send us grace!) as if through a dungeon-grate he peered, with broad and burning face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">"Alas!" (thought I, and my heart beat loud) "How fast she nears and nears! Are those her sails that glance in the Sun, like restless gossameres!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Are those her ribs through which the Sun did peer, as through a grate? And is that Woman all her crew? Is that a DEATH? And are there two? Is DEATH that woman's mate?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Her lips were red, her looks were free, her locks were yellow as gold. Her skin was as white as leprosy, the Night-Mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she, who thicks man's blood with cold.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The naked hulk alongside came, and the twain were casting dice. "The game is done! I've won! I've won!" quoth she, and whistles thrice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out: At one stride comes the dark. With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea, off shot the spectre-bark.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">We listened and looked sideways up! Fear at my heart, as at a cup, my life-blood seemed to sip!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The stars were dim, and thick the night, the steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white. From the sails the dew did drip&mdash;till clombe above the eastern bar, the horned Moon, with one bright star within the nether tip.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">One after one, by the star-dogged Moon, too quick for groan or sigh, each turned his face with a ghastly pang, and cursed me with his eye.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Four times fifty living men, (and I heard neither sigh nor groan) with heavy thump, a lifeless lump, they dropped down one by one.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The souls did from their bodies fly,&mdash;they fled to bliss or woe! And every soul, it passed me by, like the whizz of my CROSS-BOW!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">"I fear thee, ancient Mariner!" cried the Wedding-Guest. "I fear thy skinny hand! And thou art long, and lank, and brown, as is the ribbed sea-sand. I fear thee and thy glittering eye, and thy skinny hand, so brown!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">"Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest!" quoth I. "This body dropt not down!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Alone, alone, all, all alone, alone on a wide, wide sea! And never a saint took pity on my soul in agony.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The many men, so beautiful! And they all dead did lie. And a thousand thousand slimy things lived on; and so did I.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">I looked upon the rotting sea, and drew my eyes away. I looked upon the rotting deck, and there the dead men lay.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">I looked to Heaven, and tried to pray. But before ever a prayer had gusht, a wicked whisper came, and made my heart as dry as dust.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">I closed my lids, and kept them close, and the balls like pulses beat. For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky, lay like a load on my weary eye, and the dead were at my feet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The cold sweat melted from their limbs, nor rot nor reek did they. The look with which they looked on me had never passed away.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">An orphan's curse would drag to Hell a spirit from on high. But oh! more horrible than that is a curse in a dead man's eye! Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse, and yet I could not die.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The moving Moon went up the sky, and nowhere did abide. Softly she was going up, and a star or two beside.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Her beams bemocked the sultry main, like April hoar-frost spread. But where the ship's huge shadow lay, the charmed water burnt alway a still and awful red.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Beyond the shadow of the ship, I watched the water-snakes. They moved in tracks of shining white, and when they reared, the elfish light fell off in hoary flakes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Within the shadow of the ship, I watched their rich attire: Blue, glossy green, and velvet black, they coiled and swam; and every track was a flash of golden fire.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Oh, happy living things! No tongue their beauty might declare! A spring of love gushed from my heart, and I blessed them unaware. Sure my kind saint took pity on me, and I blessed them unaware.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The self-same moment I could pray; and from my neck so free, the Albatross fell off, and sank like lead into the sea.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Oh, sleep! 'Tis a gentle thing, beloved from pole to pole! To Mary Queen the praise be given! She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven, that slid into my soul.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The silly buckets on the deck, that had so long remained, I dreamt that they were filled with dew; and when I awoke, it rained.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">My lips were wet, my throat was cold, my garments all were dank. Sure I had drunken in my dreams, and still my body drank.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">I moved, and could not feel my limbs: I was so light&mdash;almost I thought that I had died in sleep, and was a blessed ghost.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">And soon I heard a roaring wind: it did not come anear. But with its sound it shook the sails, that were so thin and sere.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The upper air burst into life! And a hundred fire-flags sheen, to and fro they were hurried about! And to and fro, and in and out, the wan stars danced between.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">And the coming wind did roar more loud, and the sails did sigh like sedge. And the rain poured down from one black cloud; the Moon was at its edge.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The thick black cloud was cleft, and still the Moon was at its side. Like waters shot from some high crag, the lightning fell with never a jag, a river steep and wide.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The loud wind never reached the ship, yet now the ship moved on! Beneath the lightning and the Moon, the dead men gave a groan.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose, nor spake, nor moved their eyes. It had been strange, even in a dream, to have seen those dead men rise.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The helmsman steered, the ship moved on; yet never a breeze up blew. The mariners all 'gan work the ropes, where they were wont to do. They raised their limbs like lifeless tools&mdash;we were a ghastly crew.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The body of my brother's son, stood by me, knee to knee. The body and I pulled at one rope, but he said nought to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">"I fear thee, ancient Mariner!" "Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest! 'Twas not those souls that fled in pain, which to their corses came again, but a troop of spirits blest!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">For when it dawned&mdash;they dropped their arms, and clustered 'round the mast. Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths, and from their bodies passed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Around, around, flew each sweet sound, then darted to the Sun. Slowly the sounds came back again, now mixed, now one by one.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Sometimes a-dropping from the sky, I heard the sky-lark sing. Sometimes all little birds that are, how they seemed to fill the sea and air with their sweet jargoning!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">And now 'twas like all instruments, now like a lonely flute. And now it is an angel's song, that makes the Heavens be mute.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">It ceased; yet still the sails made on a pleasant noise till noon, a noise like of a hidden brook in the leafy month of June, that to the sleeping woods all night singeth a quiet tune.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Till noon we quietly sailed on, yet never a breeze did breathe. Slowly and smoothly went the ship, moved onward from beneath.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Under the keel nine fathom deep, from the land of mist and snow, the spirit slid: and it was he that made the ship to go. The sails at noon left off their tune, and the ship stood still also.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The Sun, right up above the mast, had fixed her to the ocean. But in a minute she 'gan stir, with a short uneasy motion&mdash;backwards and forwards half her length with a short uneasy motion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Then like a pawing horse let go, she made a sudden bound: It flung the blood into my head, and I fell down in a swound.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">How long in that same fit I lay, I have not to declare; but ere my living life returned, I heard and in my soul discerned two VOICES in the air.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">"Is it he?" quoth one, "Is this the man? By him who died on cross, with his cruel bow he laid full low, the harmless Albatross."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">"The spirit who bideth by himself in the land of mist and snow, he loved the bird that loved the man who shot him with his bow."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The other was a softer voice, as soft as honey-dew: Quoth he, "The man hath penance done, and penance more will do."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">FIRST VOICE. But tell me, tell me! Speak again, thy soft response renewing&mdash;What makes that ship drive on so fast? What is the Ocean doing?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">SECOND VOICE. Still as a slave before his lord, the Ocean hath no blast; his great bright eye most silently up to the Moon is cast&mdash;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">If he may know which way to go; for she guides him smooth or grim. See, brother, see! How graciously she looketh down on him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">FIRST VOICE. But why drives on that ship so fast, without or wave or wind?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">SECOND VOICE. The air is cut away before, and closes from behind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Fly, brother, fly! More high, more high! Or we shall be belated: For slow and slow that ship will go, when the Mariner's trance is abated.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">I woke, and we were sailing on as in a gentle weather. 'Twas night, calm night, the Moon was high; the dead men stood together.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">All stood together on the deck, for a charnel-dungeon fitter: All fixed on me their stony eyes, that in the Moon did glitter.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The pang, the curse, with which they died, had never passed away: I could not draw my eyes from theirs, nor turn them up to pray.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">And now this spell was snapt: once more I viewed the ocean green. And looked far forth, yet little saw of what had else been seen&mdash;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Like one that on a lonesome road doth walk in fear and dread, and having once turned 'round walks on, and turns no more his head; because he knows, a frightful fiend doth close behind him tread.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">But soon there breathed a wind on me, nor sound nor motion made: Its path was not upon the sea, in ripple or in shade.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek like a meadow-gale of spring&mdash;It mingled strangely with my fears, yet it felt like a welcoming.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship, yet she sailed softly too: Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze&mdash;on me alone it blew.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Oh! Dream of joy! Is this indeed the light-house top I see? Is this the hill? Is this the kirk? Is this mine own countree!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">We drifted o'er the harbour-bar, and I with sobs did pray&mdash;O let me be awake, my God! Or let me sleep alway.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The harbour-bay was clear as glass, so smoothly it was strewn! And on the bay the moonlight lay, and the shadow of the moon.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The rock shone bright, the kirk no less, that stands above the rock: The moonlight steeped in silentness the steady weathercock.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">And the bay was white with silent light, till rising from the same, full many shapes, that shadows were, in crimson colours came.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">A little distance from the prow those crimson shadows were: I turned my eyes upon the deck&mdash;Oh, Christ! What saw I there!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat, and, by the holy rood! A man all light, a seraph-man, on every corse there stood.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">This seraph band, each waved his hand: It was a heavenly sight! They stood as signals to the land, each one a lovely light.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">This seraph-band, each waved his hand, no voice did they impart&mdash;No voice; but oh! The silence sank like music on my heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">But soon I heard the dash of oars; I heard the Pilot's cheer; my head was turned perforce away, and I saw a boat appear.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The Pilot, and the Pilot's boy, I heard them coming fast: Dear Lord in Heaven! It was a joy the dead men could not blast.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">I saw a third&mdash;I heard his voice: It is the Hermit good! He singeth loud his godly hymns that he makes in the wood. He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away the Albatross's blood.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">This Hermit good lives in that wood which slopes down to the sea. How loudly his sweet voice he rears! He loves to talk with marineres that come from a far countree.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">He kneels at morn and noon and eve&mdash;he hath a cushion plump: It is the moss that wholly hides the rotted old oak-stump.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk, "Why this is strange, I trow! Where are those lights so many and fair, that signal made but now?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">"Strange, by my faith!" the Hermit said&mdash;"And they answered not our cheer! The planks looked warped! And see those sails, how thin they are and sere! I never saw aught like to them, unless perchance it were</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">"Brown skeletons of leaves that lag my forest-brook along; when the ivy-tod is heavy with snow, and the owlet whoops to the wolf below, that eats the she-wolf's young."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">"Dear Lord! It hath a fiendish look&mdash;" (The Pilot made reply) "I am a-feared"&mdash;"Push on, push on!" Said the Hermit cheerily.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The boat came closer to the ship, but I nor spake nor stirred; the boat came close beneath the ship, and straight a sound was heard.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Under the water it rumbled on, still louder and more dread: It reached the ship, it split the bay; the ship went down like lead.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound, which sky and ocean smote, like one that hath been seven days drowned my body lay afloat; but swift as dreams, myself I found within the Pilot's boat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Upon the whirl, where sank the ship, the boat spun 'round and 'round; and all was still, save that the hill was telling of the sound.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">I moved my lips&mdash;the Pilot shrieked and fell down in a fit; the holy Hermit raised his eyes, and prayed where he did sit.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">I took the oars: the Pilot's boy, who now doth crazy go, laughed loud and long, and all the while his eyes went to and fro. "Ha! ha!" quoth he, "Full plain I see, the Devil knows how to row."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">And now, all in my own countree, I stood on the firm land! The Hermit stepped forth from the boat, and scarcely he could stand.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">"Oh shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!" The Hermit crossed his brow. "Say quick," quoth he, "I bid thee say&mdash;What manner of man art thou?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched with a woeful agony, which forced me to begin my tale; and then it left me free.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Since then, at an uncertain hour, that agony returns; and till my ghastly tale is told, this heart within me burns.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">I pass, like night, from land to land; I have strange power of speech; that moment that his face I see, I know the man that must hear me: To him my tale I teach.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">What loud uproar bursts from that door! The wedding-guests are there: But in the garden-bower the bride and bride-maids singing are: And hark the little vesper bell, which biddeth me to prayer!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Oh Wedding-Guest! This soul hath been alone on a wide, wide sea: So lonely 'twas, that God himself scarce seemed there to be.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Oh sweeter than the marriage-feast, 'tis sweeter far to me, to walk together to the kirk with a goodly company!&mdash;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">To walk together to the kirk, and all together pray, while each to his great Father bends, old men, and babes, and loving friends, and youths and maidens gay!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Farewell, farewell! But this I tell to thee, thou Wedding-Guest! He prayeth well, who loveth well both man and bird and beast.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">He prayeth best, who loveth best all things both great and small; for the dear God who loveth us he made and loveth all.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The Mariner, whose eye is bright, whose beard with age is hoar, is gone: and now the Wedding-Guest turned from the bridegroom's door.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">He went like one that hath been stunned, and is of sense forlorn: A sadder and a wiser man, he rose the morrow morn.</span></p></body>
